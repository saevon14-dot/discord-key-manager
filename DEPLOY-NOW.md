### B) **"Can't upload files"**
- Use drag and drop method in GitHub
- Upload ALL project files at once

## ðŸ’¡ **The Real Issue**

Your Discord Key Management System is completely working and ready. The most common issues are:

1. **Repository not PUBLIC** - GitHub Pages requires public repos for free tier
2. **Wrong Pages source** - Must select "GitHub Actions" not "Deploy from branch"
3. **Incomplete file upload** - All project files must be uploaded
4. **Impatience** - First build takes 3-5 minutes
